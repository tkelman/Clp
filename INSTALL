Prerequisites for installation:
- at the moment on (*)nix platforms you must use g++ 2.95.2 or higher.
- must use gnu make
- to make the documentation doxygen must be installed

Targets are put in subdirectories, whose name is derived from the
platform name (as returned by `uname`) and the optimization level
(e.g., Linux-g).

To build Clp library and unitTest
  - read and edit the top of Makefile to select
      - whether shared or static library should be built
      - optimization level
      - where the compiled library should be installed
  - read and edit ../Common/make/Makefile.locations to uncomment Clp lines
  - 'make' to build and install the library.
  - 'make unitTest' to create the unitTest program. It will be placed
    in the target subdirectory.

  - 'make doc' to create the html documentation of the classes in the
    library and place them in doc/html.

To run Clp unitTest
  - clp -unitTest from Clp directory
To run Clp on netlib
  - clp -netlib from Clp directory (or -netlibp for primal).

To build Clp executable (after Clp libraries)
  In This directory 'make unitTest'.  This actually creates and executable
    clp in this directory which can both do unit test and act as simple
    Clp driver

Tuning information.  On Intel Linux I modified Makefiles/Makefile.Linux to add:

ifeq ($(OptLevel),-O1)
     CXXFLAGS += -DNDEBUG
     CXXFLAGS += -ffast-math -fomit-frame-pointer
     CXXFLAGS += -march=i686
endif

in Coin/Makefile I added the following to get dense code handling

CXXFLAGS += -DDENSE_CODE=1

and change Optimization level to -O1 (same level in Clp/Makefile.Clp).

and finally in Clp/Test/Makefile.test I added

#if DENSE and using given libraries
LDFLAGS += -llapack -lblas -lg2c

If you have not got these libraries then leave out dense code flags

For more information see README and files in Samples

IMPORTANT new note
To address the problem of stability I have gone over to a new system of releases.
Now a new release is a more minor thing but has its own snapshot.  To find out what
releases have snapshots just do

make restore

To restore Clp and Coin files to that snapshot do

make restore BACKUP=xxxx where a snapshot Clp_xxxx.tar or Clp_xxxx.tar.gz is available
and check that it looks OK.  Then do make restore BACKUP=xxxx CONFIRM=YES to actually 
overwrite files.  Then do make unitTest.

You can also create your own snapshots with make dist or make backup.  BUT use great care.
