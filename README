To build Clp see INSTALL file

To use Clp you need the Clp and Coin libraries

To make the unitTest and standalone executable do

make unitTest in this directory.  This creates an executable clp.

Running clp gives you some hints.  It can do a unit test and solve netlib 
problems.  It can also solve problems and set tolerances etc.  Just do 

clp -
 
and then try ? or setting various stuff.

On Linux clp can do file completion and line editing.  

If you want to stress the code you can set various stuff e.g. dantzig pricing
 and then go into netlib testing.  I do not guarantee that it will solve all 
netlib if you get too creative.  For instance using presolve makes netlib 
solve faster - but pilot87 prefers a large infeasibility weight.  So

clp -presolve on -dualbound 1.0e10 -netlib

works well.

There are samples in ./Samples.  Use the corresponding Makefile to 
create an executable - testit.  For later ones do "make DRIVER=sprint" etc.

At present there are only three useful samples.

minimum.cpp  This is the simplest possible program to read an mps file.

defaults.cpp.  This does not do much more, but it does it in much more 
complicated way by specifically setting defaults so it does give more
useful information.  It also prints a solution in a format "similar" to that
of MPSX.

presolve.cpp.  This is a good driver for larger problems.
