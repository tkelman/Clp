To build Clp see INSTALL file

To use Clp you need the Clp and Osi libraries

To make the unitTest and standalone executable do

make unitTest in this directory.  This creates an executable clp.

Running clp gives you some hints.  It can do a unit test and solve netlib problems.  It can also solve problems and set tolerances etc.  Just do clp - and then try ? or setting various stuff.

On Linux clp can do file completion and line editing.  

If you want to stress the code you can set various stuff e.g. dantzig pricing and then go into netlib testing.  I do not guarantee that it will solve all netlib if you get too creative.

There will be samples in ./Samples

At present the only sample is minimim.cpp; use Makefile.minimum to create testit
