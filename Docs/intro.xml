  Welcome to CLP!
  </title>
  <para>
  The COIN  Linear Program code or CLP is an open-source simplex solver written
  in C++.  It is primarily meant to be used as a callable library, but a
  basic stand-alone executable version is also available.  This
  is the first edition of the User Guide, and is to be considered a work in
  progress.
  </para>
  <para>
  This document is designed to be used in conjunction with the Samples 
  subdirectory of the Clp directory (i.e. <filename>COIN/Clp/Samples</filename>).
  In the rare event that this document conflicts with the observed behavior of
  the source code, the comments in the header files (found in
  <filename>COIN/Clp/include</filename>) are the ultimate reference.

  Prerequisites

  <para>
  CLP is written in C++, so it is expected that a user of CLP will be writing 
  C++ programs which use CLP.  Thus a working knowledge of 
  <ulink url="http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/">C++</ulink>, including basic
  object-oriented programming terminology is assumed in this document.  In
  addition, the user should be familiar with the fundamental concepts of
  <ulink url="http://carbon.cudenver.edu/~hgreenbe/courseware/LPshort/intro.html">
  Linear Programming</ulink>.
