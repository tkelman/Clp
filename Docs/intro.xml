  The COIN  Linear Program code or CLP is an open-source simplex solver written
  in C++.  It is primarily meant to be used as a callable library, but a
  basic stand-alone executable version is also available.  This
  is the first edition of the User Guide, and is to be considered a work in
  progress.

  This document is designed to be used in conjunction with the Samples 
  subdirectory of the Clp directory (i.e. <filename>COIN/Clp/Samples</filename>).
  In the rare event that this document conflicts with the observed behavior of
  the source code, the comments in the header files (found in
  <filename>COIN/Clp/include</filename>) are the ultimate reference.
